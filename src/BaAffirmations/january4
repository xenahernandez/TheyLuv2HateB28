    Take the day to heal from the lies you've told yourself and the ones
    that have been told to you -M.A

    there comes a time when we have to pause to listen to what we are telling ourselves
    "I don't know how", "I don't know if im capable enough"... yet in the midst of our
    dishonest chatter we are making great strides, accomplishing many tasks, overcoming
    seemingly insurmountable odds.

    ** --- THE TRUTH SPRINGS FORTH FROM MY MIND --- **

    May we keep our sanity and peace through it all and remind ourselves that our self created blockage and doubt
    are not us, but rather just a thought that we have given some importance to. rebuke self doubt and the lies we tell ourselves,
    the only way truth shows is through actions rather than thoughts. As we actively work towards aligning ourselves
    with the good, we will learn our real truth and know that doubt was just a thought we entertained at some point
    but chose to dismiss.
