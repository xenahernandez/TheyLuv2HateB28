    As you give, so you receive.

    if you only give to get you will not receive.
    If you give out of fear, you will not receive.
    Give anonymously without expectation or recognition.
    THE SPIRIT IN WHICH YOU GIVE DETERMINES THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU RECEIVE.
    as you give what you have, what you're not using, you make room to receive something
    else in its place.



    Prepare yourself for an outpouring of blessings.
