This page marks the official start of the github collab project titled:

                    *TheyLuv2HateB28*

The main objective of this group is to strengthen github skills through
an alternative content approach; one where the contents of this
project provide prompts that encourages our members to foster a
stronger connection with ourselves and who we aspire to be through
the cathartic power of positive affirmation and casual journaling.

*May the universe protect all of members of TL2HB28 and their loved ones*
